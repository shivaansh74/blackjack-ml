- **Comparative Analysis**: Rigorous framework to evaluate each algorithm's performance

### Advanced Technical Components
- **Professional Card Counting System**: Supports multiple counting strategies (Hi-Lo, KO, Hi-Opt I/II, etc.)
- **Dynamic Betting Optimization**: Kelly criterion, proportional betting, and progressive systems
- **Custom Blackjack Environment**: Full casino rule implementation with configurable parameters
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive statistical analysis with visualizations
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against the trained AI with strategy insights

### Research-Driven Approach
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Ensures reliable performance comparisons
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Fine-tuned models for maximum performance

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The project addresses several key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to blackjack:

1. **Sparse Rewards**: Handled through careful credit assignment and reward shaping
2. **Partial Observability**: Sophisticated state representation and probabilistic reasoning
3. **Large State Space**: Function approximation with neural networks and state abstraction
4. **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Dynamic exploration strategies with annealing schedules
