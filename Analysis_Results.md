# Blackjack AI Model Comparison: Analysis Results

## Executive Summary

This document presents an in-depth analysis of our study comparing different reinforcement learning models combined with various betting strategies in a blackjack environment. The goal was to determine which combination of AI agent and betting strategy yields the best performance in terms of return on investment (ROI), profitability, and bankroll stability over extended gameplay.

**Key Findings:**
- **Basic Strategy outperformed all reinforcement learning models**, with the Flat Betting approach achieving the highest ROI (+204% with a $2,036 profit).
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** was the best-performing AI approach, completing the full 5000 hands with multiple betting strategies.
- Most **Monte Carlo and Policy Gradient models depleted their bankrolls** before completing all 5000 hands.
- Among the betting strategies, **Flat Betting proved most reliable**, while the **Fibonacci Progression** was the riskiest strategy across all models.
- **Kelly Criterion and Anti-Martingale** showed reasonable performance when paired with the DQN model.

## Methodology

### AI Models Used
1. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: A reinforcement learning approach that uses neural networks to approximate the action-value function.
2. **Monte Carlo Methods**: Learning directly from complete episodes with smart state abstraction.
3. **Policy Gradient**: Directly optimizing playing policy through gradient ascent.
4. **Basic Strategy**: A non-AI approach implementing the mathematically optimal blackjack playing strategy.

### Betting Strategies Evaluated
1. **Flat Betting**: Consistent bet size regardless of previous outcomes
2. **Proportional to Count**: Bet size scales with the running count in card counting
3. **Kelly Criterion**: Optimal bet sizing based on edge and bankroll
4. **Oscar's Grind**: Progressive betting system that aims to recover losses gradually
5. **Martingale**: Doubling bets after losses to recover previous losses
6. **Anti-Martingale**: Doubling bets after wins to capitalize on winning streaks
7. **Fibonacci Progression**: Bet sizing follows the Fibonacci sequence

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Percentage of initial bankroll gained or lost
- **Net Profit/Loss**: Absolute dollar amount gained or lost
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of hands won
- **Bankroll Stability**: How well the strategy preserves capital
- **Hands Played**: How many hands completed before potential bankroll depletion

## Key Insights

1. **Basic Strategy Dominance**
   - The mathematically optimal Basic Strategy still outperforms reinforcement learning approaches in blackjack.
   - This suggests that blackjack may be a domain where traditional strategies already approach optimality, making it difficult for reinforcement learning to find significantly better policies.

2. **DQN's Reasonable Performance**
   - Among the AI approaches, DQN showed the most promise, likely due to its ability to better handle the large state space and credit assignment in blackjack.
   - The gap between DQN and Basic Strategy win rates (41% vs 43%) indicates there's room for improvement in the DQN implementation or training process.

3. **Critical Impact of Betting Strategies**
   - The choice of betting strategy had a more significant impact on overall performance than the difference between AI models.
   - Conservative strategies (Flat Betting, Kelly Criterion) generally outperformed aggressive strategies (Martingale, Fibonacci).

4. **Bankroll Management Importance**
   - Models with poor bankroll management strategies (Martingale, Fibonacci) quickly depleted their funds regardless of the playing strategy.
   - This highlights the importance of sound money management in gambling scenarios, even with reasonable game-playing strategies.

5. **Win Rate vs. Profitability**
   - A higher win rate doesn't necessarily translate to profitability if paired with a suboptimal betting strategy.
   - The combination of win rate and bet sizing determines the overall performance.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis of our results, we recommend the following:

1. **Strategy Selection**
   - For optimal performance, use Basic Strategy with Flat Betting or Kelly Criterion.
   - If using an AI approach, pair DQN with either Anti-Martingale or Kelly Criterion for the best balance of performance and risk.
   - Avoid Martingale and Fibonacci Progression regardless of the playing strategy.

2. **AI Model Improvements**
   - Focus future development efforts on improving the DQN model, as it showed the most promise among AI approaches.
   - Consider ensemble approaches that combine the strengths of multiple models.
   - Explore alternative neural network architectures and hyperparameter optimization to narrow the gap with Basic Strategy.

3. **Risk Management**
   - Implement strict bankroll management rules regardless of the chosen strategy.
   - Consider adaptive betting strategies that adjust based on the confidence level of the model's decisions.
   - Test smaller bet sizes with the riskier strategies to potentially extend their viability.

4. **Future Research Directions**
   - Investigate hybrid approaches combining Basic Strategy with reinforcement learning for edge cases.
   - Explore state representation improvements to better capture the game state.
   - Implement counterfactual regret minimization as an alternative learning approach.
   - Test transfer learning from models trained on simpler versions of the game.

## Limitations and Considerations

- This analysis is based on a simulation with specific rules and parameters, which may not perfectly match all real-world blackjack scenarios.
- The AI models may require additional training time or alternative architectures to reach their full potential.
- Casino-specific rules variations (such as dealer hitting on soft 17, doubling restrictions, etc.) could impact the relative performance of different strategies.
- The starting bankroll and betting limits influence the longevity and performance of various strategies.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis shows that while reinforcement learning approaches for blackjack have made significant progress, traditional Basic Strategy combined with sound betting approaches still maintains an edge. The DQN model shows the most promise among AI approaches and could potentially be further improved.

The study underscores the critical importance of betting strategy selection, which had an even greater impact on overall performance than the choice of playing strategy. Conservative betting approaches generally outperformed aggressive strategies across all models.

Future work should focus on narrowing the gap between DQN and Basic Strategy performance while maintaining the advantages of AI adaptability to different rule sets and conditions.
